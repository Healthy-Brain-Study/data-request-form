        The tables on the following pages describe per measure the status of the data in this data release.
        For each measure, it is mentioned if data has been processed (P), uploaded in repository (U), and if metadata is
        available (M). The smileys indicate which steps have been completed. We can only issue data if all steps have
        been done. Although the majority of the data is available from all participants, this may not be the case for
        all measures as preprocessing is still ongoing in some cases. If you want to request data, please note that the
        readiness of the data also depends on the type of data (e.g. MRI data requests will take longer than
        questionnaire data requests).
        Please note that many of the measures have undergone quality assurance only once. It is still possible that
        there are mistakes and we hope for your collaboration in finding those. If you are under time pressure or expect
        perfectly curated data, we kindly ask you to wait for the final data release. If you ask for any data that is
        not listed in this table as uploaded to repository, please be aware that we might need considerable time to
        issue this data.
