    <p>
        Do you request all participants or a subset (e.g., only female
        participants)?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Do you request cross-sectional data (assessment 1 only) or repeated
        measures (all 3 assessments)?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Are there any other conditions to your data request (e.g., you only want
        the MRI data from participants who also filled in a specific
        questionnaire)?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        If you request data from multiple questionnaires, measures, or tasks, it
        may be relevant to your project that the participants fulfill certain
        criteria.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>To illustrate, here are examples of the options you can choose:</p>
    <ol class="list-disc ml-4">
        <li>
            Include all participants with at least one of the requested
            measurements completed, for at least one of the three assessments.
            This option will result in the largest sample, but also the largest
            proportion of missing data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Include only participants with all three assessments of all
            requested measurements complete. This will yield the smallest sample
            size, but the least missing values. Depending on the number of
            questionnaires you request and the type of analyses you plan, this
            option may be too strict.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any other option in between these extremes. For example, for each of
            the three assessments, include only participants who completed the
            task xy, plus any of the requested questionnaires they completed for
            the corresponding assessment.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        Please think about this carefully and let us know if you have any
        questions about this.
